binary2list.cpp:
	transform the binary origin data to non-binary format as the input of TCR

compress.cpp:
	compress the origin graph data(binary) 
	input: origin csr_vlist csr_elist
	output: compress csr_vlist, compress csr_elist, info(vertex_cnt and rule_cnt and vertex_cnt + rule_cnt = compress vlist.size())

filter.cpp
	filter the rule with given threshold
	input: compress csr_vlist, compress csr_elist, info
	output: same as compress.cpp's output but filter the rule

generate.cpp
	generate non-binary format graph data
	input: after filter csr_vlist, csr_elist, info
	output: vertex_cnt rule_cnt depth and vlist elist for every depth graph data

coo2binary.cpp
	transform the coo graph data to binary format as the input of compress.cpp
	input: coo format graph file
	output: binary format graph file
